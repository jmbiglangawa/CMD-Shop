# CMDShop Activity

## Overview

CMDShop is an e-commerce command line simple Java activity program that can challenge a programmer to use basic Java syntax. The difficulty of this activity should be moderate. There's not much to talk about here, it's just a simple Java program so you can use this activity as a challenge to your approach on how you will make an e-commerce command line tool.

## Requirements
You can use Java or any programming language you are comfortable with. The instructions provided are expecting that you are using Windows and uses Powershell or CMD.

## How can I use your code then? ðŸ¤”

The code I committed is my approach to this activity based on my work experience with Java. You can use it using the following:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip folder
2. Open up your Powershell or CMD and navigate to the location of the project
3. Compile the code using the command `javac -sourcepath . Main.java -d bin`
4. Navigate to bin `cd bin` and run the Main class using `java Main`
